# Business Site

The focus of this project was to create a business site with a hero image/video for the header, a styled form with various inputs, and a drop-down 'accordian' section.

## The problem

I tried to break this week's problem down and focus on each bit one at a time, although I had a lot of difficulties trying to focus on just one area and kept getting distracted by the other ideas I had for the page. This meant that I feel the code got a little sloppy and caused me more problems than if I'd planned it out more at the start. Next time I'll use a visual planning tool at the beginning to plan out the style, then start with an html wireframing exercise before commiting to the CSS styling. I have a current issue with the video not playing on mobile. I also couldn't get some transformations to work around what I'd already created, but I didn't want to spend too much time trying to fix this as I want to focus on the new javascript elements.
